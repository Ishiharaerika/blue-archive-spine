# Requirements
- [decrunch](https://github.com/HearthSim/decrunch/)
- [fsb5](https://github.com/HearthSim/python-fsb5)
- [lz4](https://github.com/python-lz4/python-lz4)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- [astc_decomp](https://github.com/K0lb3/astc_decomp/)

# Setup
## Building UnityPack
```
setup.py build
```
## Installing UnityPack
```
setup.py install
```
or
```
setup.py install --user
```

# Downloading Models
```
py/get_models.py
```
## Configuration
```python
option = {
    # Skip resources that already downloaded.
    "skipExistingDownloadedResource": True,
    # Skip assets that already exists / extracted.
    "skipExistingAssets": True,
    # Force download even no version update.
    "forceVersion": False,
    # Download limit, mainly debug purpose since doesn't need to download all of them. Set to 0 to download all.
    "downloadLimit": 0,
    # Directory configuration
    "path": {
        # Download directory
        "download": "./assets/download/"
    }
}
```
Assets (Spine and Audio) located at ./assets

# Generating JSON Data
## data/audio.json
```
py/generate_audio.py
```
This will download VOC_JP audio instead of playing it directly (cors issue ?)

To play audio directly from BA's server, change py/generate_audio.py
```python
_type = 1
```
to
```python
_type = 0
```
## data/models.json
```
py/generate_models.py
```
## And you're done!
Just launch index.html

## Used Libraries
- [pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/)
- [pixi-spine](https://github.com/pixijs/spine)
- [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/)
